"The only good loan is one that gets paid back."

</p>

Clearly, the major part of revenues of any bank is attained through the loans they give to the people. But there are chances that the loans may not be paid back by few of the customers, making it a bad loan.

## Business Scenario:
When a customer applies for a loan, there are four types of decisions that could be taken by the customer/company:

<b>	1. Approved:  </b>	 The Company approved the loan Application.

<b>	2. Cancelled:   </b>	The client cancelled the application sometime during approval.

<b>	3. Refused:   </b>	The company rejected the loan.

<b>	4. Unused offer:   </b>	Loan has been cancelled by the client but on different stages of the process.


## Business Profitability:

The insufficient or non-existent credit history of an Urban Customer puts the bank lending company in position of dilemma about lending the loan.
This dilemma revolves around the likelihood that a customer would pay back the loan or not, and can potentially result in 2 types of loss:

<b>	1. Credit Loss:   </b>	If an applicant is not likely to repay the loan, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company.

<b>	2. Interest Loss:   </b> If an applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company.

1. application_data.csv, containing all the information of the client at the time of application. The data is about whether a client has payment difficulties. This further includes Data related to applicant’s socio economic status.
2. previous_application.csv contains information about the client’s previous loan data. It includes information that whether the previous application had been Approved, Cancelled, Refused or Unused offer.
